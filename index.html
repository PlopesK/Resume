            <p>
              Sonic R, also known as Sonic Runner, is a web-based game that I
              personally crafted using only HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS. This game
              was designed with the intention of providing entertainment,
              especially to fans of the Sonic franchise.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I immersed myself in the coding process, I injected numerous
              references and amusing elements throughout the game's interface,
              adding an extra layer of enjoyment for players. Moreover, I
              dedicated significant effort to ensuring its responsiveness, even
              catering to users with slower phones to enhance their gaming
              experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              The outcome of this project fills me with immense pride,
              reflecting the passion and dedication I poured into creating an
              engaging and user-friendly web game.

                ><u>Anemo System</u></a

              seamlessly integrated with both a website and a game. This
              innovative approach allowed teachers to efficiently manage student
              information.

              Our dedicated team worked diligently to deliver the best possible
              product. My primary contributions revolved around art-related
              elements such as the logo, site design, pixel art, etc., and I was
              responsible for programming all website-related components.
            </p>
            <p>
              One noteworthy achievement was the implementation of a robust and
              secure access system. This system required authorized accounts for
              gameplay, ensuring exclusive access tailored to the school's
              specific needs.

              The Reimagination Project was conceived as an Angular-based
              endeavor aimed at reimagining elements of the Santander website's
              homepage. This project was born from my aspiration to further my
              knowledge of Angular and TypeScript.

              Utilizing a tech stack that included HTML, CSS, SASS, Angular,
              Node.js, and the NGX-Spinners library, I embarked on this creative
              journey. It served as both a platform for skill enhancement and a
              canvas for revamping aspects of the Santander website's user
              experience.

              <p>
                Anemo System was a big project created by me and 5 friends. The
                primary goal of our team was to revolutionize the education and
                school management experience, making it both enjoyable and
                highly efficient for all stakeholders. In my capacity as the
                team leader, I spearheaded the development process, taking
                charge of website creation and providing clear instructions to
                guide our collective efforts. To streamline our workflow and
                ensure project milestones were met on time, we adopted the
                Kanban methodology, allowing us to delineate objectives and
                deadlines with precision.
              </p>

              <p>
                Notably, I also played a significant role in enhancing the
                visual appeal of our project by designing and creating most of
                the pixel art and animations featured in both the website and
                the educational game. These visual elements served to engage and
                captivate our audience, making the learning experience more
                immersive and enjoyable for all users.
